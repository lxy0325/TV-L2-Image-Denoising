# TV-L2-Image-Denoising

03.07: 
added message window for end of iteration\
parameter tuning\
tested ADMM on color image\

04.07:
improved image display features.\

06.07: 
changed iteration scheme in Split Bregman to SNR to obtain better results; \
bug to be fixed: size of input image distorted at display

07.07:
display fixed, integrated all iteration scheme to SNR to obtain better comparison;\
We notice that Split Bregman and ADMM react positively to SNR iteration stopping
while for FGP and PD the results are not quite satisfactory.
